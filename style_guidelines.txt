Overall Look and Feel of DashDrop
===============================

The overall look and feel should be minimalist and flat with a hint of playfulness. Playfulness will be highlighted by starting sentences
with small letters highlighting our break away from the norm/
The website should be gentle to use while preempting the questions the user may have and answering it.
